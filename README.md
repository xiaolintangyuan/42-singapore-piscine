## Best moments
Sharing the best (cringe) moments from the Piscine. To hide the identities of various jokers, I will just call these bunch of people ***Jokers***.

### Vote for me!!  
*Staff*: "Please vote for your 10 favourite pisciners..."  
***Joker 1***: "Please vote for me and my girlfriend so we can get to core!!!"  

### Code Quality
***Joker 1***: "Eh *xiaolintangyuan*, I'm stuck with CXX questions for very long. Since you already score 100 for CXX, can you just send me the code?"  
*Me*: "ok ok, here you go..." *zipped my codes and send them to him*  

*Moments later...*  
***Joker 1***: "Eh [*insert another expert*] found bugs in your code. You should have fixed them before sending me."  
*Me*: "But it already pass Moulinette?! Then what you want me to do?!?!"
***
### Double Standards 
*One night during my evaluation...*  
***Joker 2***: "Can you explain this code to me?"  
*Me*: "I can't remember it off the top of my head now, too tired already..."  
***Joker 2***: "I have to mark this as wrong then since you cannot explain..."  
*Me*: "ok ok..."  

*During ***Joker 2***'s evaluation...*  
*Friend*: "Can you explain this code to me?"  
***Joker 2***: "This concept very hard to explain to you like this.." Proceeds to open chrome, enter keyword  
***Joker 2***: "You read the website can already..."  
*Me*: "WTF!"

### Excuse Me

*First day of Piscine...*

***Joker 3*** (in a very unsincere rough tone): "Excuse me!!! Excuse me!!!"  
*Me*: "Yes?"  
***Joker 3***: "How do we start bash? What is bash? Can you tell me? Aren't you supposed to know?"  
*Me*: "But I'm also a fellow student..."  
***Joker 3***: "Why you don't know? Can you find someone who knows?"  
*Me*: "WTF!"

## Assignments
### Day 1
Please seek help from your peers to complete these exercises while getting to know new friends. Remember that only mutually beneficial cooperation will create lasting friendships. Single-sided leeching will only result in negative public opinion on the leecher.

### Day 4
This is the first assignment. It takes 2 - 4 hours to complete for someone with C background while a day (or two) for someone new.
Started this together with C00. Takes a couple days to complete both assignment. Remember to sign up for Rush00.
### Day 10
The fun begins.
### Day 12
Going strong now, shorter but more important exercises coming along. They are useful for later assignments.
### Day 13
Remember to go your eval(s) as you progress. If not, you might end up with insufficent eval points to proceed.
### Day 15
Time flies, 3rd week and pace is picking up. You start to see the ugly side of some.
### Day 16
Be impartial but friendly when it comes to evaluation. **Nobody** likes a rude evaluator.
### Day 17
Remember to eat your lunch, dinner and supper so you have enough brain juice for what's to come.
### Day 20
The third and final weekend, give it all you got. Remember to go out and enjoy some good time (supper) with your buddies after a long day in the lab.
### Day 21
You ask yourself why are you here on a Sunday? Don't worry, we did that as well.
### Day 22
Final week, don't waste your time doing exercises anymore. Go study for exams. Serious, just go study for exams. This is the last week. Exams are important!
