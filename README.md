## Assignments
### SH00 / SH01 - Day 1
The solutions to these assignments are not provided as they have to be performed directly via commands on the console. Please seek help from your peers to complete these exercises while getting to know new friends. Remember that only mutually beneficial cooperation will create lasting friendships. Single-sided leeching will only result in negative public opinion on the leecher.

### C00 - Day 4
This is the first C assignment. It takes 2 - 4 hours to complete for someone with C background while a day (or two) for someone new. 
### C01 - Day 4
Started this together with C00. Takes a couple days to complete both assignment. Remember to sign up for Rush00.
### C02 - Day 10
The fun begins.
### C03 - Day 12
Going strong now, C03 to C06 is relatively shorter but teach important concepts that are useful for later assignments.
### C04 - Day 13
Remember to go your eval(s) as you progress. If not, you might end up with insufficent eval points to proceed.
### C05 - Day 15
Time flies, 3rd week of the piscine and pace is picking up. You start to see the ugly side of some.
### C06 - Day 16
Be impartial but friendly when it comes to evaluation. **Nobody** likes a rude evaluator.
### C07 - Day 17
Remember to eat your lunch, dinner and supper so you have enough brain juice for what's to come.
### C08 - Day 20
The third and final weekend, give it all you got. Remember to go out and enjoy some good time (supper) with your buddies after a long day in the lab.
### C09 - Day 21
You ask yourself why are you here on a Sunday? Don't worry, we did that as well.
### C10 - Day 22
Final week, don't waste your time on this exercise. Go study for exams.
### C11 - Day 22
Serious, just go study for exams. This is the last week. Exams are important!
