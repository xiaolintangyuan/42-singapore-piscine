## Thoughts & Takeaways from this Piscine
I am glad to make new friends with like minded individuals who have a passion for coding. I also had the opportunity to discover 3 types of people in this piscine. The first type (PURISTS) are adamant that coding should be left to the genetically superior "talents". They frown at those who seek help from others, use generative AI resources or copy codes online from Github. When they evaluate others, they don't hesitate to mark the weaker ones as cheating since they are "humain sup√©rieur". The second type (SANGSUES) believe that coding is a utility. They maximise this utility by taking full advantage of all resources (people, AI, Github) to arrive at the final solution. **They won't hesistate to ask you for help but when it comes to you asking for help from them, suddenly you are like a vermin to them.** Finally, the third type (RESILIENTE) are the ones who treat coding as a skillset. They learn coding through resources & fellow mates and improve on their craft by constant practice and genuinely learning the art of coding. They are resilient; not giving up even after retrying multiple times, burning their weekends to study the fundamentals. So which type of person will ***you*** be?

## Best moments from Piscine
Sharing the best (cringe) moments from the Piscine. To hide the identities of various jokers, I will just call these bunch of people ***Jokers***.

### Vote for me!!  
*Staff*: "Please vote for your 10 favourite pisciners..."  
***Joker 1***: "Please vote for me and my girlfriend so we can get to core!!!"  

### Code Quality
***Joker 1***: "Eh *xiaolintangyuan*, I'm stuck with CXX questions for very long. Since you already score 100 for CXX, can you just send me the code?"  
*Me*: "ok ok, here you go..." *zipped my codes and send them to him*  

*Moments later...*  
***Joker 1***: "Eh [*insert another expert*] found bugs in your code. You should have fixed them before sending me."  
*Me*: "But it already pass Moulinette?! Then what you want me to do?!?!"
***
### Double Standards 
*One night during my evaluation...*  
***Joker 2***: "Can you explain this code to me?"  
*Me*: "I can't remember it off the top of my head now, too tired already..."  
***Joker 2***: "I have to mark this as wrong then since you cannot explain..."  
*Me*: "ok ok..."  

*During ***Joker 2***'s evaluation...*  
*Friend*: "Can you explain this code to me?"  
***Joker 2***: "This concept very hard to explain to you like this.." Proceeds to open chrome, enter keyword  
***Joker 2***: "You read the website can already..."  
*Me*: "WTF!"  
***
### Excuse Me

*First day of Piscine...*

***Joker 3*** (in a very unsincere rough tone): "Excuse me!!! Excuse me!!!"  
*Me*: "Yes?"  
***Joker 3***: "How do we start bash? What is bash? Can you tell me? Aren't you supposed to know?"  
*Me*: "But I'm also a fellow student..."  
***Joker 3***: "Why you don't know? Can you find someone who knows?"  
*Me*: "WTF!"

## Assignments
### SH00 / SH01 - Day 1
The solutions to these assignments are not provided as they have to be performed directly via commands on the console. Please seek help from your peers to complete these exercises while getting to know new friends. Remember that only mutually beneficial cooperation will create lasting friendships. Single-sided leeching will only result in negative public opinion on the leecher.

### C00 - Day 4
This is the first C assignment. It takes 2 - 4 hours to complete for someone with C background while a day (or two) for someone new. 
### C01 - Day 4
Started this together with C00. Takes a couple days to complete both assignment. Remember to sign up for Rush00.
### C02 - Day 10
The fun begins.
### C03 - Day 12
Going strong now, C03 to C06 is relatively shorter but teach important concepts that are useful for later assignments.
### C04 - Day 13
Remember to go your eval(s) as you progress. If not, you might end up with insufficent eval points to proceed.
### C05 - Day 15
Time flies, 3rd week of the piscine and pace is picking up. You start to see the ugly side of some.
### C06 - Day 16
Be impartial but friendly when it comes to evaluation. **Nobody** likes a rude evaluator.
### C07 - Day 17
Remember to eat your lunch, dinner and supper so you have enough brain juice for what's to come.
### C08 - Day 20
The third and final weekend, give it all you got. Remember to go out and enjoy some good time (supper) with your buddies after a long day in the lab.
### C09 - Day 21
You ask yourself why are you here on a Sunday? Don't worry, we did that as well.
### C10 - Day 22
Final week, don't waste your time on this exercise. Go study for exams.
### C11 - Day 22
Serious, just go study for exams. This is the last week. Exams are important!
